# Python Connection String

This is a tool to update excel connection strings by matching them with an SQL table. 
This allows for faster editing of multiple sheets

## installation

1. Download the repositor to your machine

2. Install the dependancies using pip install while in the root folder

```
pip install
```

## Running the program

From the root of the project, run 
```
python main.py
```

This will open a small application window. From here use the `Select Folder` button to navigate to the folder containing all the excel files you wish to edit. And the `Change Connection Strings` button to connect to the SQL table, and update all the strings.
